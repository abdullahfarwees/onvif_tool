## onvif_tool is a program that interacts with IP cameras supporting ONVIF. 
### It can:
- discover IP cameras in local network,
- provide info about camera,
- get stream URLs,
- list available resolutions and change resolution,
- subscribe to ONVIF events

It depends on gSOAP toolkit
https://www.genivia.com/products.html#gsoap
and is known to build successfully with version 2.8.106 & 2.8.123

This project was created using gSOAP ONVIF example as a reference
https://www.genivia.com/examples/onvif/index.html

Building onvif_tool.

First, make sure you have gSOAP source and tools installed. You either need to install gsoap packages from your GNU/Linux distribution repository (for example Ubuntu or Debian-based)
```sh
sudo apt-get install gsoap
```
or build gSOAP from sources yourself:

setting up the pre-requisites for Onvif_tool development.

1. Download gSOAP sources from
wget https://onboardcloud.dl.sourceforge.net/project/gsoap2/gsoap_2.8.123.zip

2. unzip gsoap_2.8.123.zip

3. cd gsoap-2.8/
./configure --prefix=/$HOME/gsoap-2.8/
make
make install

4. Configure the PATH for building

    if you are using custom built gSOAP (as described above) and not from distro repository please set these variables first
    ```sh
    export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/user/gsoap_prefix/lib/pkgconfig/
    export PATH=/home/user/gsoap_prefix/bin:$PATH
    ```

5. Install other dependencies
    ```sh
    sudo apt install build-essential
    sudo apt install pkg-config
    sudo apt install unzip
    sudo apt-get install flex bison
    sudo apt install libssl-dev
    ```
    
    optional: Install if other dependencies requires during the installation else skip this step
    **18.04LTS**
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install libgnutls28-dev
    sudo apt install libgsoap-dev
    ```
    
    **20.04 LTS**
    ```sh
    sudo apt install gawk
    sudo apt install mono-devel
    sudo apt install gsoap
    ```

6. Build onvif_tool 
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bluecherrydvr/onvif_tool.git
    cd onvif_tool
    autoreconf -i
    ./configure --prefix=/home/user/onvif_tool_prefix
    make
    make install
    ```

Deprecated steps previously used in custom build of gsoap 2.8.106. 
Note: skip this step if you already installed 2.8.123v
1. get sources from https://sourceforge.net/projects/gsoap2/files/
2. unzip 
    unzip gsoap_2.8.113.zip
3. build gsoap
    cd gsoap-2.8/
    ./configure --prefix=/home/user/gsoap_prefix
    make
    make install

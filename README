onvif_tool is a program that interacts
with IP cameras supporting ONVIF.
It can:
- discover IP cameras in local network,
- provide info about camera,
- get stream URLs,
- list available resolutions and change resolution,
- subscribe to ONVIF events

It depends on gSOAP toolkit
https://www.genivia.com/products.html#gsoap
and is known to build successfully with version 2.8.106

This project was created using gSOAP ONVIF example as a reference
https://www.genivia.com/examples/onvif/index.html

Building onvif_tool.

First, make sure you have gSOAP source and tools
installed. You either need to install gsoap packages from
your GNU/Linux distribution repository
(for example Ubuntu or Debian-based)

sudo apt-get install gsoap

or build gSOAP from sources yourself:

1) Download gSOAP sources from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/gsoap2/files/

2) unzip 

unzip gsoap_2.8.113.zip

3) build gsoap

cd gsoap-2.8/
./configure --prefix=/home/user/gsoap_prefix
make
make install

4) Build onvif_tool

#if you are using custom built gSOAP
# (as described above) 
# and not from distro repository
#please set these variables
#first
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/home/user/gsoap_prefix/lib/pkgconfig/
export PATH=/home/user/gsoap_prefix/bin:$PATH

git clone https://github.com/bluecherrydvr/onvif_tool.git
cd onvif_tool
autoreconf -i
./configure --prefix=/home/user/onvif_tool_prefix
make
make install
